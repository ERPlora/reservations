"""Every filter box this module paints is a filter the manifest actually concedes (hub#1182).

THE SYMPTOM. A column is declared `filterable`, the table draws its funnel, the person opens it and
types — and the list does not answer what was asked. Two shapes of the same lie:

  * the column is not in `list.filters` at all: the runtime only binds the `f_<col>` the manifest
    declares and drops the rest on the floor, so the box cannot work and looks exactly like one
    that found no matches;
  * the column IS declared, but with an operator its control cannot use. That is what this module
    was doing. `guest_phone` is a free-text box over a TEXT column filtered with `op: "eq"`: the
    receptionist has the phone half-written on a post-it, types `600`, and the reservations of
    `600123456` disappear — the same silence, arrived at from the other side.

WHY THIS MODULE HAS ONE. hub#1182 named five modules from a sweep of single-query screens.
`reservations` was not one of them because it paints THREE components with FOUR server-side tables
and the sweep could not attribute a column to a query. Reading them column by column found seven
boxes that lie today (see the commit); nothing in this repo said a word about any of them, and
nothing would have said a word about the next one.

The closing rule of hub#1182 is that a filter that does not filter cannot go green again. This is
that rule, for this module.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER. The occupancy table of the availability screen is not `serverSide`: it
renders rows this component computed, sends no `f_*` at all, and has nothing to promise the
manifest. The discovery skips it by construction — a table with no controller — and the floor below
counts only the ones that do talk to the runtime.

## The rules, and why each one

| The box says | The manifest must say | Because |
|---|---|---|
| `filterType: 'text'` | `op: 'like'` | a free-text box invites a fragment; `eq` empties the list unless the user types the value whole |
| `filterType: 'select'` | `op: 'eq'` | a closed domain is CHOSEN, and the value chosen is exact — `like` would silently match one value inside another |
| `filterType: 'range'` / `'daterange'` | `op: 'range'` | two bounds need the operator that takes two bounds |
| `filterable: true` | the column IS in `list.filters` | otherwise the runtime drops the `f_<col>` parameter and the box does nothing (hub#1182) |
| `sortable: true` | the column IS in `list.sort` | the sort whitelist is a SECOND door: a header outside it does not sort, silently |

A NUMERIC column pinned as `filterType: 'text'` is the trap that reads as fixed and is not: the
engine CASTS for `like` (`CAST(sub.<col> AS TEXT) LIKE '%…%'`), so `party_size` = `2` would drag
every party of 12 and 20 without a single Postgres error. What a person asks of «party size» is
«four or more», so those columns take `filterType: 'range'` + `op: 'range'` — the decision
`pricing` took for `priority` and `tables` for `capacity`.

EVERY `filterType` a column can take is checked, not the first one written. A column may pick its
control at render time (`...(this.zones.length ? { filterType: 'select' } : { filterType: 'text'
})`), and one `op` cannot serve both — `select` needs `eq`, `text` needs `like`. A gate that reads
only the first branch blesses the manifest for the path the user is NOT on, which is exactly where
the half-dead funnel hides. If a column can be two controls, it has to be honest as both, or be
filterable only when it is the one that works.

Usage: tests/filter_boxes_match_the_manifest.contract.test.py   (exit 0 = green)
  No Postgres, no Docker: it reads the manifest and the Web Components.

#:
#: And «belongs here» is ENFORCED, both ways, against the component (see `remaps`): a box the code
#: reroutes without an entry here fails, and an entry here whose remap the code no longer performs
#: fails too. Measured in review (hub#1182, the same hole as sales#261 and tables#81): with an empty
